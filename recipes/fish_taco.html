    <!-- Recipe Description -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I came up with this recipe after having fish tacos from a street vendor in Ensenada, Mexico. It is the closest to authentic I have found. Salsa can be made a day in advance for flavors to blend.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, 1 tablespoon juice from jalapeno peppers, and garlic salt in a bowl; squeeze 1/2 lime over salsa fresca. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate while preparing fish.</li>
        <li>Toss coleslaw mix with ranch dressing in a bowl; set aside for flavors to blend.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir batter mix and beer together in a bowl. Wrap corn tortillas in wet paper towels and set aside.</li>
